**Profile:** Computer Engineering Undergraduate | eCPPT Certified Professional | Active CTF Participant and Security Researcher  

**Origin of the Alias – *xffsec***
While researching buffer overflows, the byte `\xff` emerged as a consistent marker in fuzzing and payloads. Its visual form, `xff`, stood out and merged with academic use of *x* as the unknown. Combined with *sec* for security, the alias represents: **x = unknown, ff = boundary, sec = security.**

Used across bug bounty reports, CTFs, and professional work. (Pronounced *ef-sec*, *ex-ef-sec*, or simply *x*.)
